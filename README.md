## Task 1: Dataset Theme

The theme of my data set is Canadian Singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist; Justin Bieber. Having made his debut in 2009 with his album My World, Justin Bieber has since sold an estimated 150million records worldwide, and in that being one of the worlds best selling music artists. His 2009 album 'My World'went platinum in several countries, and again in 2015, he had his first number one song 'What do you Mean?', 2017 he broke the all-time record of most consecutive weeks in Top 100 with 'Despacito', and then again in 2020 his album 'Changes' made him ther youngest artist to have several albums reach the top spot on Billboard Top 200. Having followed Justin Bieber's journey from the beginning, and being a big fan of his music, encouraged me to pick him for my Dataset theme as my knowledge on both his music and him as an artist will likely help me complete upcoming tasks.
