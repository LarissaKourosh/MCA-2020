	<h1> Week 10: Audio Similarity and Transcription </h1> 
	
	<h2> Task 2 </h2>

		<h3>Transcription</h3>
      
		
		<p> Below I transcriped my composition piece from Week2 - Lonely-Justin Bieber. I have presented parts of both the original notated 
	            version compared to that of the transcriped Musescore version of which I have discussed below. </p>

		<h3> Comparison of original composition to that of the transcribed version </h3>
		
		<p> When looking at both the original composition to that of the transribed version of the piece, it is clear that the original composition 
		is more successful in effectively conveying the tune and theme of the original song. The transcribed version somewhat jumbles the notes together
			and makes it less clear what the tune/melody is. Although the transcribed version of the song resembles that of the original composition, 
			it doesn't reflect the melody in any way but instead makes it sound like the notes are combined together. </p>
