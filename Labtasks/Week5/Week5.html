	<h1> Week 5 - Standards in Curation </h1> 
	
	<h2>Task 1 - Schema of Metadata Elements - Describing Music </h2>

   <p> As demonstrated below, I have created a metadata scheme that I believe contains all the key components in describing music within a 1000-song data set. 
     The data within the scheme not only contains data related to that of the original file, such as artist, album/song titles etc.  but also data related to the transcription
     of the file/song. Including all these types of information means I am providing information not only on the original file but also the encoding and editing information in 
     relation to the project </p>
    
    <table style="width:70%">
