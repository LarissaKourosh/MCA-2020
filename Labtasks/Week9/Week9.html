	<h1> Week 9 : Extracting Meaning from Audio </h1> 
	
	<h2> Task 1 - Extract Features </h2>

		<p> Through SonicVisualiser, I extracted the spectrograms, Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients and Chromgrams of my three music tracks that
        I had decided on for Last Weeks Task. </p>

		<h3> Time Frequency Analysis VS Waveform Based Analysis </h3>

                   <p> Time Frequency Analysis is more advantageous than Waveform based analysis. This can be determined because Waveform only demonstrates changes in 
	               amplitude over time, whereas the spectrogram presents changes in both the frequencies of the signal over time and amplitude changes. 
		       As presented in the above examples, the changes in amplitude is very much demonstrated, however, unlike that in a spectogram, there is no information
		       on the changes in loudness. Contrastingly, the change of colour from 'warmer tones' such as yellow, orange and red, compared to that of 'colder tones' such
		       Green, indicates clear changes in loudness in particular points, making it clear when it the sound is louder or quieter. Information such as Time Frequencies,
		       Pitch indications and sound energy levels are all visually present through spectogram unlike Waveform, making spectrogram a notably more informative form of 
		       analysis.
