   <h2> Music curation and Analytics 2020</h2>
   
   <h1> Week 1: Music Dataset </h1>
   
   <h2> Task 1 </h2>
   <h3> Dataset theme </h3>
   
   <p> The theme of my dataset is Canadian Singer and Songwriter Justin Bieber. Having made his debut in 2009 with his album My World, Justin Bieber has since sold
   an estimated 150 million records worldwide, making him one of the worlds best selling music artists. His 2009 Album 'My World' went platinum in several countries, 
   and again in 2015 he had his first number one song 'What do you mean?', 2017 he broke the all time record of most consecutive weeks in Top 100 with 'Despacito',
    and then again in 2020 his album 'Changes' made him the youngest artist to have several albums reach the top spot on Billboard Top 200. Having followed Justin Biebers journey 
    from the beginning and being a fan of his music, i was encouraged to pick him for my dataset theme as my knowledge on his music will help me throughout the tasks. </p>
