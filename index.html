	<h1> Week 1: Music dataset </h1> 
	
	<h2> Task 1</h2>

		<h3>Dataset theme </h3>
	
		<p>The theme for my dataset for the project is based around music by Neil Young. 
		He has written, composed and performed numerous songs and the vast catalogue of his work is perfectly suitable for 
		this project, as it let access a bigger number of music scores, acoustic recording and metadata.</p> 
				
		<p>Neil Young is a Canadian-American musician, singer and songwriter. He started his music career in the 1960s 
		and has been associated with broadly defined rock genre, blues, folk, country and psychedelic influences. 
		Since his beginnings in the music industry, he has been a successful musician. At the beginning he was performing 
		with the band Buffalo Springfield, to later create legendary band Crazy Horse and to collaborate with other musicians, 
		known as CSNY  band (Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young). He is a successful and prolific solo musician as well.
		His latest new original material was an album Colorado (recorded and released in 2019) with Crazy Horse.</p>

	<h2> Task 2</h2>
			
		<h3>Data types availability and its current manifestation </h3>

		<h3> Music scores</h3>
		
		<p>Music scores to some of his best-known songs  are available online e.g. on Musescore. Other notation 
		websites also contain scores to his music, with some basic metadata, as title, artist and year of release. Most of 
		the music scores are unofficial, which means they were created and made available online by fans and other musicians.</p>
	
		<h3>Audio recordings</h3>
	
		<p>Audio recordings are available on most streaming services, such as Spotify or iTunes. Information about the albums and tracks, 
		such as time, year, label, and if applicable, editorâ€™s notes can be found there. Live Music Archive provides live audio recordings
		of his songs, coming from e.g. fan-made recordings. There are also a waveform representations of these recordings on LMA.
		Additionally Youtube provides many official videos and audio recordings as well as unofficial live and fan-made recordings, 
		which can be downloaded using external programmes.</p> 

		<h3>Metadata</h3>
	
		<p>The official site of the artist provides much information about his releases, and is a good source of metadata. 
		Noteworthy, Neil Young Archives website provides the most curated data. Each album is described in detail, with usual metadata, 
		such as song listing, time, release date, producers, alongside more advanced information about places the recordings took place, 
		catalogue number, all involved musicians and album art credentials. The site is constantly curating new material,
		as there is still a number of unreleased archival materials to be added. The official store also provides useful metadata of recordings, 
		but information there is very limited. </p>
